# Consul Connect Certificate Authority (CA)

Command: `consul connect ca`

The CA connect command is used to interact with Consul Connect's Certificate Authority
subsystem. The command can be used to view or modify the current CA configuration. See the
[Connect CA documentation](/docs/connect/ca) for more information.

```text
Usage: consul connect ca <subcommand> [options] [args]

  This command has subcommands for interacting with Consul Connect's
  Certificate Authority (CA).

  Here are some simple examples, and more detailed examples are available
  in the subcommands or the documentation.

  Get the configuration:

      $ consul connect ca get-config

  Update the configuration:

      $ consul connect ca set-config -config-file ca.json

  For more examples, ask for subcommand help or view the documentation.

Subcommands:
    get-config    Display the current Connect Certificate Authority (CA) configuration
    set-config    Modify the current Connect CA configuration
```

## get-config

This subcommand displays the current CA configuration
and has the following characteristics:

| Characteristic | Value |
| -------------- | ----- |
| [Required ACLs] | `operator:write` |
| Corresponding HTTP API endpoint | [\[GET\] /v1/connect/ca/configuration](/api-docs/connect/ca#get-ca-configuration) |

Usage: `consul connect ca get-config [options]`

#### API Options

@include 'http_api_options_client.mdx'

@include 'http_api_options_server.mdx'

The output looks like this:

```
{
	"Provider": "consul",
	"Config": {},
	"CreateIndex": 5,
	"ModifyIndex": 197
}
```

## set-config

Modifies the current CA configuration. If this results in a new root certificate
being used, the [Root Rotation](/docs/connect/ca#root-certificate-rotation) process
will be triggered.
This subcommand has the following characteristics:

| Characteristic | Value |
| -------------- | ----- |
| [Required ACLs] | `operator:write` |
| Corresponding HTTP API endpoint | [\[PUT\] /v1/connect/ca/configuration](/api-docs/connect/ca#update-ca-configuration) |

Usage: `consul connect ca set-config [options]`

#### API Options

@include 'http_api_options_client.mdx'

@include 'http_api_options_server.mdx'

#### Command Options

- `-config-file` - (required) Specifies a JSON-formatted file to use for the new configuration.
  The format of this config file matches the request payload documented in the
  [Update CA Configuration API](/api-docs/connect/ca#update-ca-configuration).

- `-force-without-cross-signing` `(bool: <optional>)` - Indicates that the CA change
  should be forced to complete even if the current CA doesn't support cross
  signing. Changing root without cross-signing may cause temporary connection
  failures until the rollout completes. See [Forced Rotation Without
  Cross-Signing](/docs/connect/ca#forced-rotation-without-cross-signing)
  for more detail.

The output looks like this:

```
Configuration updated!
```

The return code will indicate success or failure.
