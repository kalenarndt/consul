# Consul Join

Command: `consul join`

The `join` command tells a Consul agent to join an existing cluster.
A new Consul agent may join any node in the existing cluster. After joining
with one member, the gossip communication will propagate the updated membership
state across the cluster.

An agent which is already part of a cluster may join an agent in a different
cluster, causing the two clusters to be merged into a single cluster.

This command has the following characteristics:

| Characteristic | Value |
| -------------- | ----- |
| [Required ACLs] | `agent:write` |
| Corresponding HTTP API endpoint | [\[PUT\] /v1/agent/join/:address](/api-docs/agent#join-agent) |

## Usage

Usage: `consul join [options] address ...`

You may call `join` with multiple addresses if you want attempt to join the cluster
through multiple nodes. Consul will attempt to join all addresses. The join
command will fail only if Consul was unable to join any of the specified addresses.
